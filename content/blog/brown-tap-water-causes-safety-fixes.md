faqs:
  - question: "Can I shower in brown tap water?"
    answer: "Yes, showering in brown water is generally safe. Iron and rust won't absorb through your skin. However, the water may stain light-colored towels or washcloths, and some people with sensitive skin might experience minor irritation."
  - question: "Will boiling brown water make it safe?"
    answer: "No—boiling doesn't remove iron, rust, or sediment. It only kills bacteria. If you're concerned about contaminants, use a water filter or bottled water until the issue is resolved."
  - question: "How long does brown water last after hydrant flushing?"
    answer: "Typically 2-4 hours, though it can take up to 24 hours in some cases. Run your cold water periodically until it clears. If discoloration lasts longer than a day, contact your water utility."
  - question: "Should I buy a water filter for brown water?"
    answer: "For occasional brown water from utility maintenance, a filter isn't necessary—just wait for it to clear. For recurring issues, a whole-house sediment filter ($200-500 installed) catches rust and particles before they reach your faucets."
  - question: "Does brown water mean I have lead in my water?"
    answer: "Not necessarily, but there's a correlation. In homes with lead service lines, corroding pipes that cause rust can also release lead. If your home was built before 1986, or if you live in a city with known lead issues, get your water tested for lead specifically."

<p><strong>Seeing brown or yellow water coming from your faucet is alarming—but usually not dangerous.</strong> In most cases, discolored tap water is caused by iron, rust, or sediment that got stirred up in your pipes or the municipal water system. While the water may look unpleasant, it's typically safe once it clears.</p>

<p>This guide explains exactly why your tap water turned brown, when you should be concerned, and the steps to fix it.</p>

<h2>Why Is My Tap Water Brown or Yellow?</h2>

<p>Brown, yellow, or rust-colored tap water almost always comes from one of these sources:</p>

<h3>Iron and Rust in Pipes</h3>

<p>The most common cause of discolored water is <strong>iron oxidation</strong>—essentially, rust. This happens when:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Old pipes corrode:</strong> Galvanized steel and cast iron pipes break down over time, releasing rust particles into your water</li>
<li><strong>Faucet aerators rust:</strong> The small metal screen inside your faucet can accumulate rust</li>
<li><strong>Water heater sediment:</strong> Rust and minerals build up at the bottom of water heaters, especially units older than 8-10 years</li>
</ul>

<p>Cities with aging infrastructure face this issue more frequently. Older neighborhoods in Newark, <a href="/illinois/chicago">Chicago</a>, and parts of <a href="/pennsylvania/philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> have water systems over 100 years old, making rust-related discoloration more common.</p>

<h3>Municipal Water System Maintenance</h3>

<p>Your water utility might be the source—and that's usually temporary:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hydrant flushing:</strong> Fire departments test hydrants regularly, which stirs up sediment in water mains</li>
<li><strong>Water main repairs:</strong> Construction or emergency repairs can disturb settled particles</li>
<li><strong>Pressure changes:</strong> Sudden increases in water pressure dislodge rust and minerals from pipe walls</li>
</ul>

<p>Most utilities post maintenance schedules online. If your water suddenly turns brown, check your city's water department website first.</p>

<h3>Well Water Issues</h3>

<p>If you're on a private well, brown water often indicates:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>High iron content:</strong> Groundwater naturally contains iron in many regions</li>
<li><strong>Sediment intrusion:</strong> Heavy rain can wash soil particles into shallow wells</li>
<li><strong>Pump problems:</strong> A failing well pump may pull sediment from the bottom</li>
</ul>

<h2>Is Brown Tap Water Safe To Drink?</h2>

<p><strong>The short answer: Brown water from iron and rust is generally not a health risk, but you shouldn't drink it until it clears.</strong></p>

<p>Here's what the EPA says:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Contaminant</th><th>EPA Secondary Standard</th><th>Health Risk</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Iron</td><td>0.3 mg/L</td><td>Aesthetic only (taste, staining)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Manganese</td><td>0.05 mg/L</td><td>Aesthetic; high levels may affect infants</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The EPA's secondary drinking water standards for iron and manganese focus on <strong>taste, odor, and appearance</strong>—not direct health hazards. At typical levels found in brown tap water, these minerals won't harm most adults.</p>

<h3>When Brown Water IS a Concern</h3>

<p>While rust itself isn't dangerous, discolored water can sometimes signal bigger problems:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Lead contamination:</strong> In homes with lead service lines, corroded pipes can release lead along with rust. Cities like <a href="/michigan/flint">Flint</a> and Newark have experienced this issue.</li>
<li><strong>Bacterial growth:</strong> Stagnant water with high iron content can promote bacteria. If your water has an unusual odor along with discoloration, get it tested.</li>
<li><strong>Manganese exposure:</strong> While rare, very high manganese levels can be harmful—especially for infants and young children.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> If brown water persists for more than 24 hours, or if it has an unusual smell, stop using it for drinking and cooking until you identify the cause.</p>

<h2>How To Fix Brown Tap Water: Step-by-Step</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Run Your Cold Water (5-10 Minutes)</h3>

<p>Start with the simplest fix. Let your cold water run at full pressure for 5-10 minutes. In most cases—especially after utility maintenance—this flushes out the discolored water.</p>

<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Use this water for your garden or outdoor cleaning rather than letting it go down the drain.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Check If It's Your Home or the City</h3>

<p>Determine where the problem originates:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Scenario</th><th>Likely Cause</th><th>Action</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Brown water from ONE faucet</td><td>Rusty aerator or fixture</td><td>Clean or replace the aerator</td></tr>
<tr><td>Brown water from ALL cold taps</td><td>Municipal system or main pipe</td><td>Contact your water utility</td></tr>
<tr><td>Brown water from ALL hot taps only</td><td>Water heater sediment</td><td>Flush your water heater</td></tr>
<tr><td>Brown water from cold AND hot</td><td>Internal plumbing corrosion</td><td>Call a licensed plumber</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Step 3: Flush Your Water Heater</h3>

<p>If only your hot water is discolored, sediment has likely built up in your water heater:</p>

<ol>
<li>Turn off the heater (gas valve or circuit breaker)</li>
<li>Connect a garden hose to the drain valve at the bottom</li>
<li>Run the hose outside or to a floor drain</li>
<li>Open the drain valve and let water flow until it runs clear</li>
<li>Close the valve and refill the tank before turning the heater back on</li>
</ol>

<p>Most manufacturers recommend flushing water heaters annually.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Contact Your Water Utility</h3>

<p>If flushing doesn't help and multiple faucets are affected:</p>

<ul>
<li>Call your utility's water quality hotline</li>
<li>Ask if maintenance was performed recently</li>
<li>Request information about your neighborhood's pipe infrastructure</li>
<li>Ask for a free water test (many utilities offer this)</li>
</ul>

<p>Document the issue with photos and note the date and time—this helps if you need to file a complaint or request a credit on your water bill.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Test Your Water</h3>

<p>For persistent problems or peace of mind, get your water tested:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>DIY test kits</strong> ($20-50): Check for iron, lead, and basic contaminants</li>
<li><strong>Professional lab tests</strong> ($100-300): Comprehensive analysis including heavy metals and bacteria</li>
<li><strong>Free utility tests:</strong> Many public water systems offer free testing upon request</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're in a city with known water quality concerns—like <a href="/arizona/phoenix">Phoenix</a> with its hard water or older cities with lead service lines—testing is especially worthwhile.</p>

<h2>Preventing Brown Water in the Future</h2>

<h3>For Homeowners</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Replace galvanized pipes:</strong> If your home has galvanized steel plumbing (common in homes built before 1960), consider upgrading to copper or PEX</li>
<li><strong>Install a sediment filter:</strong> A whole-house sediment filter catches rust particles before they reach your faucets</li>
<li><strong>Flush your water heater annually:</strong> Prevents sediment buildup</li>
<li><strong>Run water regularly:</strong> In bathrooms or fixtures you don't use often, run water weekly to prevent stagnation</li>
</ul>

<h3>For Well Owners</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Test annually:</strong> Check iron, manganese, and bacteria levels each year</li>
<li><strong>Install an iron filter:</strong> Oxidizing filters or water softeners can remove excess iron</li>
<li><strong>Inspect your well:</strong> Have a professional check the well casing and pump every 3-5 years</li>
</ul>

<h2>When To Call a Professional</h2>

<p>Contact a licensed plumber immediately if:</p>

<ul>
<li>Brown water persists for more than 24 hours after flushing</li>
<li>You notice a <strong>strong rotten egg smell</strong> (possible hydrogen sulfide or bacteria)</li>
<li>Water pressure drops significantly along with discoloration</li>
<li>You see <strong>rust stains</strong> appearing on fixtures, laundry, or dishes consistently</li>
<li>Your home was built before 1986 and may have lead pipes</li>
</ul>

<p>For homes in cities with aging infrastructure—including parts of <a href="/california/los-angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="/michigan/detroit">Detroit</a>, and <a href="/maryland/baltimore">Baltimore</a>—a plumbing inspection can identify corroding pipes before they cause bigger problems.</p>

<h2>Brown Water vs. Other Discoloration</h2>

<p>Not all discolored water has the same cause:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Water Color</th><th>Common Cause</th><th>Risk Level</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>Brown/Rust</strong></td><td>Iron, rust, sediment</td><td>Low (aesthetic)</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Yellow/Orange</strong></td><td>Iron, tannins, utility flushing</td><td>Low (aesthetic)</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Cloudy/Milky</strong></td><td>Air bubbles, hard water</td><td>Very low</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Green/Blue</strong></td><td>Copper corrosion</td><td>Moderate (test recommended)</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Black specks</strong></td><td>Manganese, rubber gaskets</td><td>Low to moderate</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>If your water is cloudy or milky rather than brown, it's usually just air bubbles—fill a glass and wait 30 seconds. If it clears from the bottom up, it's harmless dissolved air.</p>
