<h3>What These States Do Right</h3>

<p>The top-ranked states share several characteristics:</p>

<p><strong>Protected source water:</strong> Hawaii draws from underground aquifers protected by volcanic rock. Colorado and Oregon benefit from mountain snowmelt. Minnesota's 10,000+ lakes provide abundant, clean surface water.</p>

<p><strong>Strong infrastructure investment:</strong> Kentucky has invested heavily in water treatment, to the point where Louisville Water trademarked its product as "Louisville Pure Tap®"—something few utilities would dare attempt.</p>

<p><strong>Proactive regulation:</strong> Washington State adopted PFAS standards stricter than federal requirements and launched a public dashboard showing contamination levels by area.</p>

<p><strong>Low industrial impact:</strong> States like South Dakota and Nebraska have lower population density and less industrial activity that could contaminate water sources.</p>

<h2>The 10 States with the Worst Tap Water</h2>

<p>These states have the most EPA violations, aging infrastructure, or persistent contamination issues:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Rank</th><th>State</th><th>Primary Issues</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>50</td><td><strong>Texas</strong></td><td>23,628 violations; aging rural infrastructure</td></tr>
<tr><td>49</td><td><strong>Pennsylvania</strong></td><td>21,527 violations; legacy industrial contamination</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td><strong>Arizona</strong></td><td>Very hard water (285+ ppm); customer complaints</td></tr>
<tr><td>47</td><td><strong>West Virginia</strong></td><td>8,490 violations; coal industry impact</td></tr>
<tr><td>46</td><td><strong>Oklahoma</strong></td><td>Aging systems; nitrate contamination</td></tr>
<tr><td>45</td><td><strong>New Mexico</strong></td><td>Arsenic in groundwater; drought stress</td></tr>
<tr><td>44</td><td><strong>Alaska</strong></td><td>Remote systems hard to maintain; septic issues</td></tr>
<tr><td>43</td><td><strong>Louisiana</strong></td><td>Industrial pollution; hurricane damage to systems</td></tr>
<tr><td>42</td><td><strong>Ohio</strong></td><td>Lead service lines; agricultural runoff</td></tr>
<tr><td>41</td><td><strong>New York</strong></td><td>Large number of systems; inconsistent quality</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Why These States Struggle</h3>

<p><strong>Aging infrastructure:</strong> Texas and Pennsylvania have thousands of small water systems, many with pipes over 50 years old. Replacing lead service lines and upgrading treatment plants requires billions in investment.</p>

<p><strong>Industrial legacy:</strong> West Virginia's coal industry and Louisiana's petrochemical corridor have left lasting impacts on water sources. Some contamination predates modern EPA regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Geographic challenges:</strong> Arizona's water comes from the Colorado River and deep wells, both naturally high in minerals. Alaska's remote communities make system maintenance extremely difficult and expensive.</p>

<p><strong>Agricultural runoff:</strong> Oklahoma and Ohio face nitrate contamination from farming operations, which can exceed safe levels in rural areas.</p>

<p><strong>Important note:</strong> Being on this list doesn't mean the water is unsafe to drink. All public water systems must meet federal safety standards. Lower rankings indicate more violations, more reason to test your water, and potentially more benefit from home filtration.</p>

<h2>How We Rank Water Quality</h2>

<p>State water quality rankings come from several key sources:</p>

<h3>EPA Violation Data</h3>

<p>The EPA's Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS) tracks every violation at every public water system in America. Violations include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Health-based violations:</strong> Contaminants exceeding safe levels</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring violations:</strong> Failure to test as required</li>
<li><strong>Reporting violations:</strong> Late or missing reports</li>
<li><strong>Treatment technique violations:</strong> Not treating water properly</li>
</ul>

<p>States with more water systems naturally have more potential violations, which is why per-capita rates matter.</p>

<h3>Contaminant Levels</h3>

<p>The Environmental Working Group (EWG) tracks contaminant levels beyond just EPA limits, comparing them to health-based guidelines that are often stricter than legal requirements.</p>

<p>Common contaminants measured:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lead and copper</li>
<li>Disinfection byproducts (THMs, HAAs)</li>
<li>Nitrates</li>
<li>PFAS ("forever chemicals")</li>
<li>Arsenic</li>
<li>Radium</li>
</ul>

<h3>Customer Satisfaction</h3>

<p>J.D. Power surveys water utility customers on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Water quality and taste</li>
<li>Reliability of service</li>
<li>Communication from utility</li>
<li>Billing accuracy</li>
<li>Conservation programs</li>
</ul>

<p>This captures the human experience of water quality beyond just lab numbers.</p>

<h2>Best Tap Water by Region</h2>

<p>Water quality often follows regional patterns:</p>

<h3>Pacific Northwest: Excellent</h3>

<p><a href="/washington/seattle">Seattle</a> and <a href="/oregon/portland">Portland</a> benefit from protected mountain watersheds and consistent rainfall. Both cities have soft water (under 30 ppm hardness) and minimal violations.</p>

<h3>Upper Midwest: Very Good</h3>

<p>Minnesota, Wisconsin, and the Dakotas have abundant freshwater resources and relatively low industrial impact. Cities like <a href="/minnesota/minneapolis">Minneapolis</a> consistently rank well for water quality.</p>

<h3>Rocky Mountains: Good</h3>

<p><a href="/colorado/denver">Denver</a> and other Colorado cities get clean snowmelt water, though hardness can be moderate. Utah and Wyoming also benefit from mountain sources.</p>

<h3>Northeast: Mixed</h3>

<p>New York City actually has excellent water—NYC draws from protected Catskill reservoirs and has some of the softest water in the country (35 ppm). But other parts of the Northeast, especially Pennsylvania, struggle with aging systems.</p>

<h3>Southwest: Challenging</h3>

<p><a href="/arizona/phoenix">Phoenix</a>, <a href="/nevada/las-vegas">Las Vegas</a>, and other desert cities face very hard water (200-300+ ppm) and drought-stressed supplies. The Colorado River, which supplies much of the region, has naturally high mineral content.</p>

<h3>Southeast: Variable</h3>

<p>Some Southern states like Tennessee and Kentucky rank well, while Louisiana and parts of Florida face industrial or agricultural contamination challenges.</p>

<h3>Texas: Highly Variable</h3>

<p>Texas is huge, with over 7,000 water systems. Cities like <a href="/texas/houston">Houston</a> and <a href="/texas/dallas">Dallas</a> have modern treatment plants and good water quality, but many rural systems struggle with compliance.</p>

<h2>Cities with the Best Tap Water</h2>

<p>While state rankings provide a broad picture, water quality ultimately varies city by city. These cities consistently rank among the best:</p>

<h3>Top 10 Cities for Water Quality</h3>

<h2>How to Check Your State's Water Quality</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Find Your Water Utility</h3>

<p>Most Americans get water from a public system. Your utility is required to publish an annual Consumer Confidence Report (CCR) with test results.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Read the CCR</h3>

<p>Look for:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Detected contaminants</strong> and their levels</li>
<li><strong>Violations</strong> in the past year</li>
<li><strong>Water source</strong> (surface or groundwater)</li>
<li><strong>Treatment methods</strong> used</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 3: Use the EPA's Tools</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>EPA Drinking Water Dashboard:</strong> Search violations by state and utility</li>
<li><strong>EWG Tap Water Database:</strong> Search by ZIP code for detailed contaminant data</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 4: Test Your Home Water</h3>

<p>Even in states with great water, your home's plumbing matters. Older homes may have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lead service lines (pre-1986)</li>
<li>Galvanized steel pipes that corrode</li>
<li>Lead solder in copper pipes</li>
</ul>

<p>A home water test ($20-150) can identify issues specific to your plumbing.</p>

<h2>Does State Ranking Really Matter?</h2>

<p><strong>Yes and no.</strong></p>

<p>State rankings tell you about overall infrastructure quality and regulatory enforcement. If you're in a top-ranked state, you're less likely to encounter problems.</p>

<p>But water quality ultimately depends on:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Your specific water system:</strong> A poorly-maintained system in Minnesota can be worse than a well-run system in Texas</li>
<li><strong>Your home's plumbing:</strong> Lead pipes affect water quality regardless of state</li>
<li><strong>Your location within the state:</strong> Urban systems often differ dramatically from rural ones</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Use state rankings as a starting point, then check your specific utility's reports and consider testing your home water for complete peace of mind.</p>

<h2>What About Well Water?</h2>

<p>Approximately 13 million American households rely on private wells, which aren't covered by EPA regulations or state rankings.</p>

<p>If you're on well water:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Test annually</strong> for bacteria, nitrates, and pH</li>
<li><strong>Test every 3-5 years</strong> for heavy metals and other contaminants</li>
<li><strong>Test after changes:</strong> flooding, nearby construction, or changes in taste/smell</li>
</ul>

<p>Well water quality depends entirely on local geology and your well's construction—state rankings don't apply.</p>

<h2>Improving Your Water Quality</h2>

<p>Regardless of where you live, you can improve your tap water:</p>

<h3>For Hard Water (Common in AZ, NV, FL, TX)</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Water softener:</strong> Removes calcium and magnesium ($500-2,500 installed)</li>
<li><strong>Reduces:</strong> Scale buildup, dry skin, spotted dishes</li>
</ul>

<h3>For Lead Concerns (Older homes, certain cities)</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Reverse osmosis:</strong> Removes 95%+ of lead ($150-500)</li>
<li><strong>NSF-certified pitcher filter:</strong> Affordable option ($20-40)</li>
<li><strong>Run water before drinking:</strong> Flush pipes for 30 seconds each morning</li>
</ul>

<h3>For Taste and Odor Issues</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Activated carbon filter:</strong> Removes chlorine taste and odors ($50-200)</li>
<li><strong>Refrigerator pitcher:</strong> Simple solution for drinking water</li>
</ul>

<h3>For Comprehensive Protection</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Whole-house filtration:</strong> Treats all water entering your home ($1,000-3,000)</li>
<li><strong>Best for:</strong> Homes with multiple concerns or well water</li>
</ul>
